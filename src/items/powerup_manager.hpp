/** This class manages all powerups. It reads in powerup.xml to get the data,
 *  initialise the static member of some flyables (i.e. powerup.xml contains
 *  info about cakes, plunger etc which needs to be stored), and maintains
 *  the 'weights' (used in randomly chosing which item was collected) for all
 *  items depending on position. The latter is done so that as the first player
 *  you get less advantageous items (but no useless ones either), while as the
 *  last you get more useful ones.
 *
 *  The weights distribution is described in the powerup.xml file in more
 *  detail. All weights are stored in the m_all_weights data structure,
 *  which maps the race mode (race, battle, ...) to a list of WeightsData
 *  instances. Each WeightsData instance stores the data for one specific
 *  number of karts. E.g. m_all_weights['race'] contains 5 WeightsData
 *  instances for 1, 5, 9, 14, and 20 karts.
 *  At race start a new instance of WeightsData is created in
 *  m_current_item_weights. It contains the interpolated values for the
 *  number of karts in the current race (e.g. if the race is with 6 karts
 *  if will use 3/4 the weights for 5 karts, and 1/4 the weights for 9 karts.
 *  Then m_current_item_weights will create a weight distribution for each
 *  possible rank in the race (1 to 6 in the example above). This is the
 *  interpolation of the values within one WeightsData. Atm there are also
 *  5 entries in that list (though it does not have to be the same number
 *  as above - i.e. the 1, 5, 9, 14, 20 weights list). Similarly the actual
 *  distribution used for a kart with a specific rank is based on dividing
 *  the available ranks (so 6 karts --> 6 ranks). With the 5 specified values
 *  the first entry is used for rank 1, the last entry for rank 6, and ranks
 *  2-5 will be interpolated based on an equal distance: in a race with 6
 *  karts for example, the 2nd weight list is used for rank 2.25, the 3nd
 *  for rank 3.5, the 4th for rank 4.75 (and the first and last for rank 1
 *  and 6). It does not matter that the ranks are non integer: the actual
 *  weights used for say rank 2, will then be interplated between the weights
 *  of rank 1 and 2.25 (e.g. 0.8*weights_for 2.25 + 0.2*weights_for 1).
